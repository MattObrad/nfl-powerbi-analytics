# NFL Analytics Dashboard — Power BI + SQL Database

This is a project where I took real NFL game data and turned it into an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal was to build more than a spreadsheet, I wanted a small end-to-end analytics pipeline that pulls raw data, cleans it, stores it in a database, and visualizes it in a way that makes trends easier to understand.

The result is a dashboard that breaks down league scoring, team performance, home vs away results, and head-to-head matchups across multiple seasons.

## What the Dashboard Shows
- League scoring trends over time
- Team performance by season
- Home vs away win rates
- Point differential
- Matchup history between any two teams
- Trend lines and forecasting

## Project Structure
### Data Source
- Historical NFL game results.
### Transformation
- Cleaned and prepped using Python or R.
### Database
- Loaded into a SQL database for structured access and modeling.
### Visualization
- Connected to Power BI to create interactive dashboards with filters, drill-through, and slicers.

## Tech Used
- Power BI Desktop
- SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server)
- Python or R for data preparation
- GitHub for version control

## Why I Built This
I wanted a hands-on project that shows the whole process, not just the visualization but the part where messy raw data becomes useful. Sports data makes it more engaging because the trends are easy to relate to and fun to dive into.

## How to Run It
- Clone the repository
- Create the database and run the SQL scripts
- Run the data prep script
- Open the .pbix file and connect it to your database
